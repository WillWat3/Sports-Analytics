Hello! My name is Dak, I was born in Oregon but raised in Michigan, where I’ve spent a lot of my life. I also had the honor of serving in the United States Air Force for four years, which allowed me to experience life in some fantastic places like Texas, New Mexico, and Nevada.
When I’m not focused on my studies or work, I’m all about embracing the great outdoors. I love riding dirt bikes, spending quiet afternoons fishing, and getting my hands dirty with gardening. I am also a huge audiophile some I am always looking for the next best song, artist and bands. Some of my favorite bands/artist are Tokyo Police Club, Giovannie and the Hired Guns, and Anderson .Paak. Football is another passion of mine—I enjoy watching U of M and Detroit Lions games and sometimes the Oklahoma Sooners (thank my wife for that one.) And when I need a break, my wife and I dive into some video games like Call of Duty and Overwatch 2
